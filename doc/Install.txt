Installing pyxrs
================

Requirements:
-------------
If you do not have these packages installed locally follow the provided links 
to install them. Usually the most recent 'stable version' is best. 

* Python (3.5 or higher)  (http://www.python.org/download/), 
* Numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
* Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)

After installing python and associated packages, make sure the python installation 
directory is on your systems 'PATH' so that `>>python3` works from your command line


Install
-------
* You can download the source code as a zipfile from: 
  https://github.com/ttrainor/pyxrs/archive/master.zip

* Or clone the project using git: 
  ` >>git clone http://github.com/ttrainor/pyxrs.git `

* Unpack the distribution and cd into the pyxrs directory

* Install the packages into your site-packages using: 
  `>>python3 setup.py install `

* This will install 2 seperate packages:  xtal and xtlgeo
  You can edit the setup file to only install one of the packages
  if you like, or to install it to a custom location.

* Note that the examples, docs and html files are not "installed" 
  using the above procedure.  Put these directories where you want them...

* To run the examples cd into the example directory and:
  '>>python3 example_script.py'

* If youd rather not install the package and rather run it as is
  just add the pyxrs folder to your PYTHONPATH
