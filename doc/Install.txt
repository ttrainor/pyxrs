Installing pyxrs
================

Requirements:
-------------
If you do not have these packages installed locally follow the provided links 
to install them. Usually the most recent 'stable version' is best. 

* Python (3.5 or higher)  (http://www.python.org/download/), 
* Numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
(* Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/))

After installing python and associated packages, make sure the python installation 
directory is on your systems 'PATH' so that `>>python` works from your command line


Install pyxrs into 'site-packages'
-----------------------------------
* You can download a recent source tarball (or zipfile) from the 
  download page (https://github.com/xraypy/tdl/downloads)

* Or you can download the most recent source using git: 
  ` >>git clone http://github.com/xraypy/tdl.git `

* Install into your site-packages using: `>>python setup.py install `
