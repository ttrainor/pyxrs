Installing pyxrs
================

Requirements:
-------------
If you do not have these packages installed locally follow the provided links 
to install them. Usually the most recent 'stable version' is best. 

* Python (3.5 or higher)  (http://www.python.org/download/), 
* Numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
* Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)

After installing python and associated packages, make sure the python installation 
directory is on your systems 'PATH' so that `>>python` works from your command line


Install pyxrs into 'site-packages'
-----------------------------------
* You can download the source code as a zipfile from: 
  https://github.com/ttrainor/pyxrs/archive/master.zip

* Or clone the project using git: 
  ` >>git clone http://github.com/ttrainor/pyxrs.git `

* Install into your site-packages using: `>>python setup.py install `
